# Batch File for Automating FFmpeg Video Creation

This batch file automates the process of creating a video from a static image and an audio file using FFmpeg. The output is a simple MP4 video file where the image is displayed while the audio plays.

## Features

- **User Input**: The batch script prompts the user to input the name of the audio file (MP3) to be used in the video.
- **Automatic Detection**: If the user does not provide an input, the script automatically detects the MP3 file in the working directory.
- **Error Handling**: The script checks if the specified or detected MP3 file exists before proceeding.
- **FFmpeg Integration**: Uses FFmpeg to create an MP4 video from the specified image (`logo.jpg`) and audio file.

## Requirements

- **FFmpeg**: Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible from the command line. You can download FFmpeg from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
- **Windows**: This batch file is designed to run on Windows systems.

## Usage

1. Place the `logo.jpg` image and the `mysong.mp3` audio file in the same directory as the batch file.
2. Run the batch file by double-clicking it or executing it from the command prompt.

   - If there is only one MP3 file in the directory, you can simply press `Enter` when prompted to automatically select that file.
   - If there are multiple MP3 files, enter the name of the desired file when prompted.

3. The script will create an `output.mp4` file in the same directory.


If you press `Enter` without typing anything, the script will automatically detect and use the available MP3 file.

## Notes

- The `logo.jpg` file must be in the same directory as the batch script.
- The output video will be saved as `output.mp4` in the same directory.

## Troubleshooting

- **File Not Found**: If the script cannot find the specified audio file, ensure the file name is correct and the file is in the same directory as the script.
- **FFmpeg Errors**: If FFmpeg fails to run, ensure that FFmpeg is installed and properly added to your system's PATH.
